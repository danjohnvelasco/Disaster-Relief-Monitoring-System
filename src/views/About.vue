        The Lasallian Mission at DLSU is essentially the mission of the entire University 
        community as expressed in its Vision-Mission Statement. Each member is invited to 
        integrate this Mission with their specific role and expertise; whether in 
        administration, academics or research, contributing their part to the University 
        becoming a resource for Church and nation.

        In line with this, the Center for Social Concern and Action (COSCA), the social development 
        arm of De La Salle University, will be making use of the Lasallian Disaster Relief System. 
        COSCA is the primary unit responsible for the leadership, advancement, and general oversight 
        work on promoting the Lasallian Social Development (LSD) principles and social formation 
        values of the Lasallian Guiding Principles.

        The LaSallian Disaster Relief (LSDR), as part of the Lasallian Social Development 
        Principles, aims to bridge those affected in unforeseen and unfortunate events to those 
        who can help them. The LSDR system is also opening its door to other La Salle schools in
        the Philippines and their partner communities to address relief needs when disaster strikes.
        Schools under the De La Salle Philippines and the partner communities of these schools are
        able to meet the first wave of relief when disaster strikes. LSDR offers data transparency
        that enables the Lasallian community and beyond to see what is needed and what they, as part
        of one community, do to contribute.
